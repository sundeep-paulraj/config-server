Microservices based software development is becoming the de facto standard in the development community. The 12-factor app (https://12factor.net/) provides a set of principles that assists in microservice based software architecture. One of these principles is separation of configuration from the codebase, and to be made available to the runtime environment.  Spring boot cloud config (https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-config) server is a popular configuration server app that's in use. 

This repo is for runninng my configuration server, which would consume the configuration from config-repo (https://github.com/sundeepk1/config-repo).
